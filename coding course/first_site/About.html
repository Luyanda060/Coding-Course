           <div>Durban based ladies wear designer, Pinky Dlamini is the owner and creative director of our brand Modesta.
           Modesta Creation and Designing cc is a young black owned company operating from KwaNdengezi Township in Durban. 
           She was inspired to join the fashion industry when she became fascinated with the process of taking an idea and bringing it to life form 
           of sketch before translating it into a completed garment through the use of fabrics, trimmings and technical skill.
           She obtained a National Diploma in Fashion obtained from Durban University of Technology.
           Her vision is to tell our African stories to the world through our fashion craftsmanship of garments and also be the best supplier of
           African inspired everyday and occassional women's wear. She is captivated by layer of fabrics, African and tribal paints, bead work
           and embellishments which help provide the colourful, afrocentric palette that is evident in her collection.
